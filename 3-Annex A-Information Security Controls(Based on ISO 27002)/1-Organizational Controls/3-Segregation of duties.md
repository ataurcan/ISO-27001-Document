**Purpose** 
    To reduce the risk of fraud, error and bypassing of information security controls.

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Separate conflicting duties (e.g., approval and execution). 
- Use monitoring, audit trails and supervision if segregation is difficult. 
- Use role-based access carefully and avoid conflicting roles.

**Other Information**
    Small organizations should apply the principle as far as practical.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Limited staff in small organizations makes segregation impractical. 
- Identifying and managing conflicting roles requires mature access governance. 
- Technical implementation of SoD can be complex and costly.
