**Purpose** 
    To protect the organization's assets as part of the process of changing or terminating employment, contract or agreement.
    
**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Include asset return in termination/ change processes.
- Cover physical and electronic assets, authentication devices and records. 
- Ensure secure data transfer and deletion if personal devices are used.

**Other Information** 
    Use controls to restrict data if assets cannot be fully returned

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Asset tracking is often incomplete, especially for remote workers or shared devices.
- Secure return or wiping of personal devices used for work is frequently overlooked. 
- Procedures for revocation during role changes are inconsistently followed.
