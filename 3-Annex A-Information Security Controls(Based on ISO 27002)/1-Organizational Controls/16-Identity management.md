**Purpose** 
    To allow for the unique identification of individuals and systems accessing the organization's information and other associated assets and to enable appropriate assignment of access rights.


**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Use unique IDs for people and devices. 
- Manage lifecycle of identities (creation, modification, removal). 
- Synchronize identity management across systems.

**Other Information** 
    Helps prevent unauthorized use.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Multiple systems may lead to fragmented or duplicated identities. 
- Lifecycle events (e.g., departure, role change) are not always promptly updated. 
- Integration between HR and IT systems is often weak or manual.
