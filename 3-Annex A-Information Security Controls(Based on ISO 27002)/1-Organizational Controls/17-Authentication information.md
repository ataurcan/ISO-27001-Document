**Purpose** 
    To ensure proper entity authentication and prevent failures of authentication processes.

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Use strong authentication methods.
- Securely store and transmit authentication info.
- Change default credentials and enforce password management.

**Other Information** 
    Multi-factor authentication is recommended.


**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Weak password policies or poor user practices persist in many environments. 
- Default credentials and insecure storage (e.g., spreadsheets) are common risks.
- Multi-factor authentication adoption is inconsistent across systems.
