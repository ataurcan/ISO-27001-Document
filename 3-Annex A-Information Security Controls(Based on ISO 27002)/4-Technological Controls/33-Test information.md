**Purpose** 
    To ensure relevance of testing and protection of operational information used for testing.

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Use synthetic or anonymized data when possible. 
- Secure test environments to same level as production. 
- Control access to test systems and data.

**Other Information** 
    Include requirements in test plans and policies.


**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Real production data is frequently reused in testing due to convenience.
- Lack of anonymization tools or practices poses confidentiality risks. 
- Test environments are often less secure than production, making them a soft target.
