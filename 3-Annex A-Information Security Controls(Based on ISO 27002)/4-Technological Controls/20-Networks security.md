**Purpose** 
    To protect information in networks and its supporting information processing facilities from compromise via the network.

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Use firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems. 
- Segment networks where appropriate.
- Monitor network traffic.

**Other Information** 
    Apply secure network architecture principles.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Network segmentation is often missing or poorly implemented.
- Traffic monitoring lacks coverage or generates too many false alerts. 
- Network design lacks alignment with secure architecture principles.
