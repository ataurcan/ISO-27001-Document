**Control**
    Information processing facilities should be implemented with redundancy sufficient to meet availability requirements.

**Purpose** 
    To ensure the continuous operation of information processing facilities.

**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Implement failover and clustering mechanisms. 
- Test redundancy arrangements regularly. 
- Monitor redundant systems for performance.

**Other Information** 
    Align with business continuity requirements.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Redundancy is often designed but not tested under real failure conditions. 
- Monitoring of failover performance is limited or nonexistent.
- Small organizations may lack resources for full redundancy.
