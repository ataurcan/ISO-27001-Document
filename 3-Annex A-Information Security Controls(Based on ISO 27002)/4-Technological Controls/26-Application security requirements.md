**Purpose** 
    To ensure all information security requirements are identified and addressed when developing or acquiring applications.

**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Apply security requirements at each SDLC phase. 
- Conduct security testing and code reviews. 
- Train developers on secure coding practices.

**Other Information**
    Align with industry best practices.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Development teams may resist security activities that slow delivery.
- Secure SDLC practices are inconsistently applied across project types. 
- Lack of integration between security teams and developers leads to gaps.
