**Control** 
    Secure authentication technologies and procedures should be implemented based on information access restrictions and the topic-specific policy on access control.

**Purpose** 
    To ensure a user or an entity is securely authenticated, when access to systems, applications and services is granted.


**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Use strong passwords or passphrases. 
- Apply multi-factor authentication where feasible.
- Protect authentication data in storage and transmission.

**Other Information**
    Consider biometrics and token-based methods.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application**
- Many systems still rely on weak or outdated authentication mechanisms. 
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is not implemented universally. 
- Secure storage and transmission of credentials are not always enforced.
