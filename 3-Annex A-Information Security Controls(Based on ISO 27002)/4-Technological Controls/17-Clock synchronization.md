**Purpose** 
    To enable the correlation and analysis of security-related events and other recorded data, and to support investigations into information security incidents.

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Use secure and trusted time sources. 
- Automate synchronization where possible. 
- Check synchronization regularly.

**Other Information** 
    Supports incident investigation and evidence integrity.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Inconsistent clock sync causes unreliable event correlation during investigations. 
- Secure time sources are not always used, risking tampering. 
- Sync checks are often manual or overlooked.
