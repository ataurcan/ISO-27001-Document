**Purpose**
    To ensure only authorized users, software components and services are provided with privileged access rights.

**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Grant privileged rights based on business needs only. 
- Use separate accounts for admin tasks. 
- Monitor and review privileged accounts regularly.

**Other Information** 
    Apply multi-factor authentication where feasible.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Privileged accounts are often granted permanently without periodic review. 
- Use of shared admin credentials persists in many environments. 
- Monitoring privileged activity is technically complex and under-resourced.
