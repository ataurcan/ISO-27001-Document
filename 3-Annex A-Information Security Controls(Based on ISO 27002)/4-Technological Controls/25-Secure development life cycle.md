**Control** 
    Rules for the secure development of software and systems should be established and applied.

**Purpose** 
    To ensure information security is designed and implemented within the secure development life cycle of software and systems.

**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Generate, store and destroy keys securely. 
- Rotate keys regularly and after compromise.
- Assign responsibilities for key management.

**Other Information**
    Use hardware security modules if needed.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application**
- Manual key lifecycle processes are error-prone and lack accountability. 
- Rotation and revocation procedures are not standardized or automated. 
- Storage practices may expose keys to compromise if not using HSMs.
