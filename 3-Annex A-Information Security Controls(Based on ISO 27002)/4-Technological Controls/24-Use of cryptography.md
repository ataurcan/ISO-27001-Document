**Control** 
    Rules for the effective use of cryptography, including cryptographic key management, should be defined and implemented.

**Purpose** 
    To ensure proper and effective use of cryptography to protect the confidentiality, authenticity or integrity of information according to business and information security requirements, and taking into consideration legal, statutory, regulatory and contractual requirements related to cryptography.

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Define key management practices.
- Select suitable algorithms and key lengths.
- Comply with legal and regulatory encryption requirements. 

**Other Information** 
    Applies to data at rest, in use and in transit.


**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application**
- Encryption standards are inconsistently applied across systems. 
- Key lengths or algorithms may be outdated or non-compliant with regulation. 
- Staff often lack understanding of when and how to apply encryption.
