**Purpose**
    To protect the production environment and data from compromise by development and test activities 

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Implement physical or logical separation of environments. 
- Restrict access based on roles and responsibilities. 
- Use different credentials for each environment.

**Other Information** 
    Prevents accidental changes to live systems.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Smaller organizations may lack resources for physical or logical segregation. 
- Access controls between environments are often weak or not enforced. 
- Using shared credentials across environments increases risk of accidental changes.
