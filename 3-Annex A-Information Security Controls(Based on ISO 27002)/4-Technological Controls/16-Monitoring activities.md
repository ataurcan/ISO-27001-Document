**Control**
    Networks, systems and applications should be monitored for anomalous behaviour and appropriate actions taken to evaluate potential information security incidents.

**Purpose** 
    To detect anomalous behavior and potential information security incidents.

**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Use automated monitoring tools.
- Define normal activity baselines.
- Review monitoring results regularly.

**Other Information** 
    Integrate with incident response processes.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Monitoring tools may not cover all systems or are poorly tuned.
- Lack of baselines makes anomaly detection unreliable. 
- Integration with incident response processes is inconsistent.
