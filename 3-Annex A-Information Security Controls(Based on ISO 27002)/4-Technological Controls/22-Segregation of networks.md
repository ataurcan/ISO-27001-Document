**Purpose**
    Minimize risk by isolating sensitive systems and reducing exposure between different network zones.Improving containment during potential attacks

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Use VLANs, firewalls or DMZs for segmentation. 
- Isolate critical systems from less secure zones. 
- Document and maintain segmentation architecture.

**Other Information** 
    Regularly review segmentation effectiveness.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Network segmentation is frequently poorly documented or outdated. 
- Organizations struggle to isolate critical systems without impacting usability. 
- Reviews of segmentation effectiveness are often skipped.
