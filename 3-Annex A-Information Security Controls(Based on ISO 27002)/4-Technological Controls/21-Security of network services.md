**Purpose** 
    To ensure security in the use of network services.

**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Define security requirements for network services in contracts.
- Implement appropriate encryption and authentication. 
- Monitor network service performance and security.

**Other Information** 
    Applies to internal and third-party services.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Security features are often not clearly defined or enforced in service contracts. 
- Encryption and authentication controls vary across internal and third-party services. 
- Network service monitoring is reactive rather than continuous.
