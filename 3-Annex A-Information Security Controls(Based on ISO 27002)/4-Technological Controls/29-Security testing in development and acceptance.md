**Purpose** 
    To validate if information security requirements are met when applications or code are deployed to the production environment.

**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Use input validation, error handling and secure libraries. 
- Perform static and dynamic code analysis. 
- Provide developer training on secure coding.

**Other Information** 
    Align with secure SDLC processes.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Developers may lack training in secure coding practices. 
- -Static/dynamic analysis tools are not used regularly or are misconfigured. 
- Secure coding guidelines are outdated or not enforced.
