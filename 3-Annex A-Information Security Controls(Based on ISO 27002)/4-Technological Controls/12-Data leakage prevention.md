**Purpose** 
    To detect and prevent the unauthorized disclosure and extraction of information by individuals or systems. 

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Use DLP solutions to monitor and block unauthorized transfers. 
- Educate staff on handling confidential data. 
- Monitor endpoints, networks and storage devices.

**Other Information** 
    Align DLP policies with data classification.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- DLP tools are complex to configure and often generate high false positives. 
- Staff may bypass controls using unsanctioned channels (e.g., personal email).
- Endpoint and mobile DLP coverage is frequently insufficient.
