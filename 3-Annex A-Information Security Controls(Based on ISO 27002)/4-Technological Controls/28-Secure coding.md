**Purpose** 
    To ensure software is written securely thereby reducing the number of potential information security vulnerabilities in the software.

**Guidance (Summary)** 
- Follow defense-in-depth and least privilege principles. 
- Use standard frameworks and patterns. 
- Document design decisions and security controls.

**Other Information** 
    Applies to hardware and software systems.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Secure design principles are poorly understood or inconsistently followed.
- Documentation of design decisions is often incomplete or missing. 
- There is little alignment with recognized architectural frameworks.
