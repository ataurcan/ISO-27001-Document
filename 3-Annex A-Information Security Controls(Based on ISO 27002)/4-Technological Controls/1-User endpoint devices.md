**Purpose** 
    To protect information against the risks introduced by using user endpoint devices.

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Apply device encryption and strong authentication.
- Use endpoint protection software (antivirus, firewall). 
- Monitor and manage device configurations remotely.

**Other Information**
    Includes laptops, smartphones, tablets and BYOD.


**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Managing and securing BYOD and mobile endpoints across various platforms is challenging.
- Device encryption and remote management are often inconsistently implemented. 
- Endpoint protection tools may be outdated or not centrally monitored.
