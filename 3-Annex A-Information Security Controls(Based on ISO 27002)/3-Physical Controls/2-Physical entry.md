**Purpose** 
     To ensure only authorized physical access to the organization's information and other associated assets occurs.

**Guidance (Summary)**
- Use identification, authentication and visitor logs. 
- Accompany visitors and restrict unattended access. 
- Revoke access rights promptly when no longer needed.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application** 
- Visitor logging and escorting practices are often inconsistent. 
- Access revocation after role changes or terminations is delayed. 
- Relying on outdated access control systems increases risk.
