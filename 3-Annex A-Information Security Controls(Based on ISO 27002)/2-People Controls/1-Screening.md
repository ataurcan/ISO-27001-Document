**Purpose** 
    To ensure all personnel are eligible and suitable for the roles for which they are considered and remain eligible and suitable during their employment.

**Guidance (Summary)**

- Use background checks where lawful. 
- Repeat checks if needed for high-risk roles.

**Difficulties in Control Interpretation and Application**
 -Screening processes may conflict with local labor or privacy laws, limiting effectiveness. 
 -Role sensitivity is not always assessed systematically, leading to inconsistent background checks. 
 -Repeat screenings for sensitive roles are rarely implemented.
