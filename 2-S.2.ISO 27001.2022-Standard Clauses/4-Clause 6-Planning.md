**6.1 Actions to address risks and opportunities**

**6.1.1 General Requirements** 

When planning for the information security management system, the organization shall consider the issues referred to in 4.1 and the requirements referred to in 4.2 and determine the risks and opportunities that need to be addressed to:
a) ensure the information security management system can achieve its intended outcome(s);
b) prevent, or reduce, undesired effects; 
c) achieve continual improvement. 
The organization shall plan: 
d) actions to address these risks and opportunities; and 
e) how to
1) integrate and implement the actions into its information security management system processes; 
2) evaluate the effectiveness of these actions.

**6.1.2 Information security risk assessment** 
The organization shall define and apply an information security risk assessment process that:
a) establishes and maintains information security risk criteria that include: 
1) the risk acceptance criteria; and 
2) criteria for performing information security risk assessments;
b) ensures that repeated information security risk assessments produce consistent, valid and comparable results; 
c) identifies the information security risks:
3) apply the information security risk assessment process to identify risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability for information within the scope of the information security management system; and 
4) identify the risk owners
The organization shall define and apply an information security risk assessment process that: 
d) analyses the information security risks: 
5) assess the potential consequences that would result if the risks identified in 6.1.2 c)6) were to materialize
6) assess the realistic likelihood of the occurrence of the risks identified in 6.1.2 c) 1); and 
7) determine the levels of risk;
e) evaluates the information security risks: 
8) compare the results of risk analysis with the risk criteria established in 6.1.2 a); and
9) prioritize the analysed risks for risk treatment. 
The organization shall retain documented information about the information security risk assessment process.

**6.1.3 Information security risk treatment** 
The organization shall define and apply an information security risk treatment process to: 
a) select appropriate information security risk treatment options, taking account of the risk assessment results; 
b) determine all controls that are necessary to implement the information security risk treatment option(s) chosen; 
  NOTE 1: Organizations can design controls as required, or identify them from any source.
c) compare the controls determined in 6.1.3 b) above with those in Annex A and verify that no necessary controls have been omitted; 
  NOTE 2 Annex A contains a list of possible information security controls. Users of this document are directed to Annex A to ensure that no necessary information security controls are overlooked. NOTE 3 The information security controls listed in Annex A are not exhaustive and additional information security controls can be included if needed.
The organization shall define and apply an information security risk treatment process to:
d) produce a Statement of Applicability that contains:
  • the necessary controls (see 6.1.3 b) and c));
  • justification for their inclusion; 
  • whether the necessary controls are implemented or not; and
  • the justification for excluding any of the Annex A controls. 
e) formulate an information security risk treatment plan; and 
f) obtain risk owners' approval of the information security risk treatment plan and acceptance of the residual information security risks.

The organization shall retain documented information about the information security risk treatment process. NOTE 4 The information security risk assessment and treatment process in this document aligns with the principles and generic guidelines provided in ISO 31000.


**6.2 Information security objectives and planning to achieve them** 

The organization shall establish information security objectives at relevant functions and levels. The information security objectives shall:
a) be consistent with the information security policy; 
b) be measurable (if practicable);
c) take into account applicable information security requirements, and results from risk assessment and risk treatment; 
d) be monitored; 
e) be communicated; 
f) be updated as appropriate; 
g) be available as documented information.

When planning how to achieve its information security objectives, the organization shall determine:
h) what will be done;
i) what resources will be required;
j) who will be responsible; 
k) when it will be completed; and 
I) how the results will be evaluated.

**Example: Planning for Achieving Information Security Objectives**
**Objective**: Reduce successful phishing attacks by 40% within the next 12 months.
**What will be done?** Conduct monthly phishing simulations, deliver staff training, implement enhance email filtering. 
**What resources are needed?** Training platform, phishing simulation software, upgraded email security tools, staff time. 
**Who is responsible?** Information Security Manager, with support from IT and HR. 
**Timeline for completion:** Six-month rollout with quarterly progress reviews.
**How will results be evaluated?** Monitor phishing simulation click rates, training participation rates, and incident reports.

**6.3 Planning of changes** 
When the organization determines the need for changes to the information security management system, the changes shall be carried out in a planned manner.
